How, if at all, does this output projection differ in MQA and GQA?\n",

You are doing H number of cheaper attention calculations. It allows model to learn different types of representations to attend to within a same sequence length. For language, one head could capture gramatical structure attention scores, another could capture emotional attention scores etc. In MQA, GQA, keys and values are shared across all attention layers or within a group. In GQA, hidden dim size is D/G, so it still is needed but dimensions would be diff from MQA.**\n",

In all three architectures, the concatenated output of the attention heads is a tensor of shape $(\\text{sequence_length}, \\text{hidden_dimension})$. The output projection matrix is a linear layer that takes this tensor and projects it back to the same hidden dimension. Therefore, the output projection matrix is always of size $(\\text{hidden_dimension} \\times \\text{hidden_dimension})$, regardless of whether the K and V matrices are shared. The sharing of K and V only impacts the number of parameters before the attention score calculation, not the final projection.\n",

        "The output projection is a crucial and often overlooked part of the attention block. It serves two primary purposes:\n",

        "1.  **Dimensionality Alignment**: Each of the $H$ attention heads produces an output tensor of shape $(\\text{sequence_length}, \\text{head_dimension})$. These are then concatenated along the dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape $(\\text{sequence_length}, H \\times \\text{head_dimension})$. Since $\\text{head_dimension} = \\frac{\\text{hidden_dimension}}{H}$, this concatenated tensor has a shape of $(\\text{sequence_length}, \\text{hidden_dimension})$. The output projection is a linear layer that takes this concatenated tensor and transforms it using a weight matrix of size $(\\text{hidden_dimension} \\times \\text{hidden_dimension})$, projecting it back to the hidden dimension. This ensures the output can be added to the residual connection and processed by the next block of the transformer.\n",
        "2.  **Information Fusion**: This is the most important conceptual reason you touched upon. The output projection allows the model to learn how to optimally combine the diverse information from all the different attention heads. Each head may have focused on a different aspect of the input (e.g., syntax, semantics, long-range dependencies), and the output projection learns a weighted average or combination of these outputs to create a single, rich representation that is then passed to the next layer.\n",
